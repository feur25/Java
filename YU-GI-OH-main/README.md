# YU-GI-OH

This is my final project for school.

It's the first full version, but you can add every card you want.

On [src/sample/icons](https://github.com/gregalli02/YU-GI-OH/tree/main/src/sample/icons) you can find all the images to run this program :smile:

I've used Intellij 2020 and Scene Builder.

Use it responsibly!
